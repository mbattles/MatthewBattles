<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Matthew Battles is a maker and thinker whose work merges literary, scholarly, and artistic forms of inquiry. His writing on the cultural dimensions of science and technology appears such venues as <i>The American Scholar</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>. His most recent book, a material and cultural history of writing entitled <i>Palimpsest: A History of the Written Word</i>, was published by W. W. Norton in 2015.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As associate director of metaLAB (at) Harvard, Matthew advances an agenda of creative research exploring the dark abundance of collections in libraries and museums; technology’s impact on our experience of art, culture, and the natural world; and the conditions of culture and experience in the context of deep time. This work takes varied form in writing, video, and multimedia installation, in works like A Bit in the Abyss (with metaLAB), a multimedia architectural installation for Boston’s 2015 Illuminus festival; and <i>Your Story Has Touched My Heart</i> (with Sarah Newman, 2016), an appropriation piece exploring memory and mystery in photo archives.</span></p>
