  "body": "Matthew Battles is a maker and thinker whose work merges literary, scholarly, and artistic forms of inquiry. His writing on the cultural dimensions of science and technology appears such venues as _The American Scholar_, _The Atlantic_, _Harper’s Magazine_, and _The New York Times_. His most recent book, a material and cultural history of writing entitled _Palimpsest: A History of the Written Word_, was published by W. W. Norton in 2015. \r\n\r\nAs associate director of metaLAB (at) Harvard, Matthew advances an agenda of creative research exploring the dark abundance of collections in libraries and museums; technology’s impact on our experience of art, culture, and the natural world; and the conditions of culture and experience in the context of deep time. This work takes varied form in writing, video, and multimedia installation, in works like A Bit in the Abyss (with metaLAB), a multimedia architectural installation for Boston’s 2015 Illuminus festival; and _Your Story Has Touched My Heart_ (with Sarah Newman, 2016), an appropriation piece exploring memory and mystery in photo archives.\r\n\r\n",
